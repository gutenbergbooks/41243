<p>The sole purpose of this book is to help the children
to learn to read. While it may ultimately lead to the acquisition
of knowledge concerning many subjects, its present aim is
only to make reading easy. The lessons are, therefore, on subjects
familiar to every child. The words are such as children
habitually use in conversation; they are introduced gradually,
and as a rule are repeated many times. Since proficiency in
reading is best attained by much practice, care has been taken
to present as large an amount as possible of interesting matter
which the child can readily master. Every line is for the pupil
to read. The stories are so constructed as to encourage and
secure naturalness of expression without the intervention of rules
or formal drills. The gradation both in thought and in expression
is easy and natural.</p>

<p>Although the learning of words by much repetition and familiarity
with their forms is an essential feature of this book, its
foundation is nevertheless phonetic. Yet, for the sake of leaving
it perfectly adaptable to any method of teaching, the phonetic
basis has not been emphasized. The systematic introduction of
words which may serve as key-words for the acquisition of others
containing similar phonetic elements has been carefully observed,
and it is believed that this is the natural method untrammeled by
any artificial classification.</p>

<p>As further aids toward making the child's first reading lessons
easy, the sentences are short. There are no broken lines in the
first hundred pages. Indentations help the young reader to keep
the place. There are no interfering illustrations in the text.
Each story is complete without turning a leaf.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgments are extended to Miss Frances Lilian
Taylor of Galesburg, Illinois, to Mr. W. J. Button of Chicago,
and to Miss Matilda Mitchell, primary teacher, Phillips Brooks
School, Boston, for valuable suggestions and assistance.</p>

<h4>SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h4>


<p>As stated on the preceding page, the foundation of this work is phonetic.
The author believes that children may profitably learn many words without
reference to their phonetic composition, and that among these certain key-words
should be selected from which the elementary sounds of the language
may be developed. These elements will give the pupils the power of acquiring
new words. For example, observe the following key-words and the sounds
developed from them:&mdash;</p>

<p>Observe the great number of easy and common words that may be developed
from the sounds thus learned from the first ten key-words named
above. The list includes <i>an</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>ran</i>, <i>had</i>, <i>pan</i>, <i>man</i>, <i>tan</i>, <i>let</i>, <i>met</i>, <i>pet</i>, <i>bet</i>, <i>men</i>,
<i>pen</i>, <i>fig</i>, <i>did</i>, <i>bit</i>, <i>little</i>, <i>not</i>, <i>lot</i>, <i>got</i>, <i>hot</i>, <i>log</i>, and a great many more. Similar
key-words emphasizing the remaining sounds should be selected as the work
proceeds. Teachers preferring to introduce the sounds less rapidly, may teach
these first words as words and select others later in the book to serve as key-words.
The blackboard should be in constant use, and the pupils' ingenuity
in forming new words and new sentences should be tested at every recitation.
The few exercises in script given at the beginning of the book are suggestive
of the manner in which much additional drill in reading may be presented on
the blackboard. The diacritical marks should not be taught to the children.</p>

"See, Robert, see!" said Marian.<br />
"That little bird did not fly to the sunny South.<br />

"That is a snowbird," said Robert.<br />
"It likes the snow. It does not mind the cold. It stays here all winter."</p>

"Oh, yes. One story is about a little boy who went to sleep in the meadow.<br />
I don't know what his name was, but they called him Little Boy Blue.<br />
He took care of the sheep and the cows. He had a horn to blow.<br />
The sheep and the cows would come when they heard the horn."<br />

<h4>DRIVING THE COWS</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">Robert lives on a farm.<br />
His father is a farmer.<br />
Robert helps his father.<br />
He helps take care of the chickens and the lambs.<br />
Sometimes he drives the cows to the meadow.<br />
Sometimes he drives them home at night.<br />
"Where are the cows, Robert?"<br />
"I think they are in the meadow."<br />
"Will you not drive them home? It is time to milk them."<br />
"Yes, father, I will bring them home. I like to drive them.<br />
I will take the dog with me.</p>

<h4>THE BOX OF TOOLS</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">Frank lives in the city.
He has never seen a farm.
He has never seen a brook.<br />
He has never heard the robins singing in the tree tops.<br />
A river runs by the city. Sometimes Frank goes down to the river to see the
boats and ships.<br />
Sometimes he plays in the street by his home.<br />
The street is not a good place to play.<br />
Frank has many playthings, and he is as happy as any farmer boy.<br />
He   would not be happy on a farm.</p>

There is no snow on the ground now.<br />
The days are warm and bright. The sun is high in the sky.<br />
Soon the ground will be green with grass.<br />
There are wild flowers in the woods now.<br />
All the birds have come back from the South.<br />
The robin is here. He is building a nest in the old tree.<br />
Soon there will be some little blue eggs in the nest.<br />
The old owl did not go South. But he is glad that spring has come.</p>

<h4>THE FIVE GOATS</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">Five goats were in a field.<br />
There they found green grass to eat, and good water to drink.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
At night the farmer's boy and his little sister came to drive them home.<br />
One night the goats wanted to stay in the field.<br />
The little girl ran after them. But she could not drive them out.<br />
"Now I will try," said the boy.<br />
So the boy ran after the goats. But they would not go out for him.<br />
Just then a dog came by.<br />
"Let me try," said the dog.<br />
"I have more legs than a boy. I can run faster."<br />
He ran after the goats.<br />
He barked and barked. But the goats would not go out of the field.<br />
Soon a fox came to see what the dog was doing.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
"Let me try," he said. "I know more than a dog, and I can run fast."<br />
The fox ran after the goats. But he could not drive them out of the field.<br />
"Let me try," said a horse that was looking on. "I am big and strong."<br />
But the goats would not go out for the horse.<br />
A busy bee came into the field.<br />
"Buzz! buzz!" it said. "I think I can drive them out. Let me try."<br />
"What can you do? You are too little to drive goats," said the boy.<br />
"You are smaller than I am," said the little girl.<br />
"You can not bark," said the dog.<br />
"You don't know much," said the fox.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
"You can't run round the field on four feet," said the horse.<br />
"Buzz, buzz, buzz!" said the bee.<br />
"We will see; we will see;" and away it flew.<br />
It flew by the big goat's ear.<br />
"Buzz, buzz, buzz!" it said.<br />
The goat looked up. "What is that?" he said; and he ran out of the field.<br />
The little goat looked up. "If you go out, I will go out," he said; and out he ran.<br />
"So will I. So will I. So will I," said the three white goats; and all ran out of the field.<br />
Then the boy and his sister drove the goats home.<br />
"If the bee had not helped us, what could we have done?" they said.</p>

<h4>MAKING BUTTER</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;">Do you know how I make butter? I will tell you.<br />
Every day the cows give us fresh milk.<br />
Ned brings the milk to the house.<br />
I have some large tin pans. At night I put the fresh milk in these pans.<br />
In the morning I find yellow cream on the top of the milk.<br />
Then I take off the cream and put it in my churn.<br />
I churn and churn till the cream turns to butter.<br />
I take the butter out.<br />
I leave the buttermilk in the churn.</p>
